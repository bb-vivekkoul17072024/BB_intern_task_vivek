cluster ip service:
🌐 Step-by-Step Flow of Cluster IP Traffic
1. The Client Sends a Request (Inside the Cluster)
When a pod (let's say app-pod) wants to communicate with another service, it doesn’t directly know the IP addresses of the target pods. Instead, it uses the Cluster IP assigned to the service.

Example:
If app-pod wants to call the nginx-cluster-ip service (which exposes NGINX pods), it sends a request to the Cluster IP or the DNS name of the service.

The DNS name would be:

Edit
nginx-cluster-ip.default.svc.cluster.local
where:

nginx-cluster-ip → service name
default → namespace
svc.cluster.local → cluster’s internal DNS suffix
Kubernetes' DNS (CoreDNS) resolves this name to the Cluster IP.

2. Service Receives the Request
The Cluster IP is a virtual IP — it doesn’t belong to any specific node or pod. Instead:

It is managed by kube-proxy running on every node.
kube-proxy sets up iptables (or IPVS rules) to forward traffic sent to the Cluster IP to one of the backend pods (which match the service’s selector).
How does kube-proxy know which pods to forward to?

It watches the API server for updates about services and endpoints (pods that match the service's selector).
It builds a dynamic routing table, so traffic sent to the Cluster IP is load-balanced across healthy pods.
3. Load Balancing to a Pod
When kube-proxy receives the request:

It uses round-robin load balancing (by default) to pick a pod.
It forwards the traffic to the targetPort of the chosen pod — this is the port the container is actually listening on (defined in the service manifest).
Example from the service YAML:

yaml

ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80       # Service (Cluster IP) port
    targetPort: 80  # Pod container port
So, if the Cluster IP is 10.100.200.50, kube-proxy might forward the request like this:

nginx

Client -> Cluster IP (10.100.200.50:80) -> Pod IP (10.244.1.12:80)
4. Pod Processes the Request
The NGINX pod now receives the request at its container port (80).

The pod processes it like any typical web server would — for example, serving a web page or handling an API request.
The pod generates a response and sends it back.
5. Response Travels Back to the Client
The response from the pod travels back:

From the pod’s IP to the node's kube-proxy.
Kube-proxy ensures the response takes the same path back to the requesting pod (to maintain connection state).
Finally, the response reaches the original client (which could be another pod or a Kubernetes component).
The client gets its response, and the cycle completes.

Client Pod (app-pod) sends request to Cluster IP:
   curl http://nginx-cluster-ip:80

Flow of traffic:

1. Client Pod -> Cluster IP (10.100.200.50:80)
2. kube-proxy intercepts the request.
3. kube-proxy load balances to a Pod IP:
   - Pod 1 IP (10.244.1.12:80)
   - Pod 2 IP (10.244.2.15:80)
4. NGINX Pod processes request.
5. Response travels back via the same path.
✅ Why Use Cluster IP?
Stability: Pods are dynamic — they can be created or deleted anytime, but Cluster IP remains stable.
Internal Communication: Best for service-to-service communication inside the cluster.
Scalable: kube-proxy automatically updates routes as pods scale up/down.
